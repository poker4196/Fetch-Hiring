----1. What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?

--First I will create a view by 4 tables Receipts, Customer_Orders, Products, and Brand:

CREATE VIEW VIEW1 AS (
SELECT R.id ReceiptID, R.dateScanned TIME, B.CategoryCode Brand from Receipts R, Customer_Orders C, Products P, Brands B
WHERE R.id = C.receiptId AND C.barCode = P.barCode AND P.brandCode = B.brandCode);

--Then I retrieved top 5 brands by receipts scanned in requested time. I assigned values t1 at begin of the month and t2 at the end of month that we want to retrieve information.
For Example, the beginning of the month is 1609632000000 and the end is 1609632896000:

SELECT * FROM (
SELECT Brand, COUNT(*) C FROM VIEW1 GROUP BY Brand WHERE TIME >= t1 AND TIME < t2 )
ORDER BY C DESC NULLS LAST
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;


----2. How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?

_ To compare our record with top 5 brand last months or any month we want, just replace t1 and t2 with values that we calculate.


---3. When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?


SELECT (case when A.AVG(totalSpent) > B.AVG(totalSpent)  then 'ACCEPTED IS BIGGER'
             when A.AVG(totalSpent) < B.AVG(totalSpent)  then 'REJECTED IS BIGGER'
             else 'REJECTED = ACCEPTED'
        end)
FROM
(SELECT AVG(totalSpent) FROM Receipts WHERE rewardReceiptStats = 'Accepted') AS A,
(SELECT AVG(totalSpent) FROM Receipts WHERE rewardReceiptStats = 'Rejected') AS B;


---4. When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

SELECT (case when A.SUM(totalSpent) > B.SUM(totalSpent)  then 'ACCEPTED IS BIGGER'
             when A.SUM(totalSpent) < B.SUM(totalSpent)  then 'REJECTED IS BIGGER'
             else 'REJECTED = ACCEPTED'
        end)
FROM
(SELECT SUM(totalSpent) FROM Receipts WHERE rewardReceiptStats = 'Accepted') AS A,
(SELECT SUM(totalSpent) FROM Receipts WHERE rewardReceiptStats = 'Rejected') AS B;
