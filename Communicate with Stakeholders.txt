1. Data Design:

_ If we add Customer_Orders table, we can solve irregular rewardsReceiptItemList features and make our data reasonalble.
_ Same as with cpg and products data, we add them to normalize our data and make them structured in relational Database.

2. Data Quality Issues:

_ There are missing data in some feafures with a large percentage of missing data (above 35% to above 50%)
_ This issues may come from initial inappropriate data design.
_ We will apply EDA and analyze data to do Feature selection for those missing data.
